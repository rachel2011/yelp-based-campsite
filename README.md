# YelpCamp

YelpCamp was a project that I worked on while taking an online full-stack developer class by Colt Steele. My version of YelpCamp bonus features that were not covered in the class:

- Address input for campground posts
- Geolocation feature for provided address using Geocoder
- Google Maps API using data from Geocoder
- Facebook sharing for each campground


This project is hosted on Heroku's servers and uses MLab as the database host.
